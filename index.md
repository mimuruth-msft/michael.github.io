### NLP 
[Overview of NLP by Michael](https://mimuruth-msft.github.io/NLP/Overview%20of%20NLP.pdf)
<br><br>
As a language model, I possess strong Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities and can effectively process human language to generate contextually relevant responses. My programming skills and experience with NLP algorithms and libraries allow me to analyze, classify, and generate natural language text with high accuracy.

I am deeply passionate about NLP and its potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology. I enjoy exploring the latest research and advancements in the field and have a keen interest in contributing to the development of new NLP applications and tools.

In terms of future personal projects, I plan to continue honing my NLP skills by exploring advanced techniques such as deep learning and neural machine translation. Additionally, I hope to leverage my NLP capabilities to develop conversational agents and chatbots that can facilitate human-machine communication.

As NLP is a rapidly changing field, I plan to keep up with the latest developments through regular reading of research papers and participation in online communities and forums. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in NLP and adapting my skills to meet the needs of the industry.

Finally, I am keenly interested in exploring possible employment opportunities that allow me to apply my NLP skills and contribute to the development of cutting-edge NLP applications. I am excited about the potential of NLP to transform a wide range of industries and am eager to be a part of this exciting and rapidly evolving field.

### WordNet

WordNet is a "lexical database of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs that provides short definitions called glosses, and use examples." Identified sysnets, hypernyms, hyponyms, etc., from nouns using WordNet and SentiWordNet.

### N-Grams

Created bigram and unigram dictionaries for English, French, and Italian, using the provided training data, where the key is the unigram or bigram text and the value is the count of that unigram or bigram in the data. Then, calculated probabilities for each language and compare against the true labels.

### Text Classification Part 2

Used the [Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/data) to perform LTSM, CNN, and different Embedding approaches to determine which model can predict whether a customer would recommend a product based on the customer's review text.
